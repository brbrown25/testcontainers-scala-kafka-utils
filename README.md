# testcontainers-scala-kafka-utils
A library which takes inspiration from [embedded kafka](
https://github.com/embeddedkafka/embedded-kafka)

At it's core it provides similarly named functions
which can be utilized with test containers to proved a
smooth experience. Initially this will focus on support for fs2 kafka integration but will branch out to support vanilla and zio.
